### Conflict Resolution

Work load sharing plan: If one person is pulling all of the weight we can handle this by approaching the person professionally and then elevating to instructors as necessary.

We will approach the challenge of building an application by allowing one mulligan so the other person can use their mulligan to trump a desired feature.
